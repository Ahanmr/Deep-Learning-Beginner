Wildlife images captured in a field represent a challenging task while classifying animals since they appear with a different pose, cluttered background, different light and climate conditions, different viewpoints, and occlusions. Additionally, animals of different classes look similar. All these challenges necessitate an efficient algorithm for classification.  In this challenge, you will be given 19,000 images of 30 different animal species. Given the image of the animal, your task is to predict the probability for every animal class. The animal class with the highest probability means that the image belongs to that animal class.
